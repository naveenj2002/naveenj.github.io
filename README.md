My website consists of three pages: Home, About and Blog
# Home Page:
The home page is what the website is about.
# About Page:
The about page is a description about myself.
# Blog page:
This page consists of all the blogs I have ever posted on this website.
# Repository Layout:
My repository consists of the following:

_layouts : it consists of the jekyll code for maintaining the layout of the whole website.

_posts : it consists of all the blog posts.

about : this consists the code for the about page while using jekyll.

blog : this consists of the code for the blog page while using jekyll.

css : this consists of the initial css code for the website.

.gitignore : this file tells Git to ignore the ‘_site’ directory that Jekyll automatically generates each time you commit.

README.md : this is the read me file(i.e. the code for what you are viewing now.)

_config.yml : this file tells Jekyll some basics about your project.(i.e. the name of the website and version of markdown.)

index.html : *code for the home page.
